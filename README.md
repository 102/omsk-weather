# omsk-weather

This repo contains historical data of Omsk weather. To take a look, you can
either directly open `history.csv`, or open a
[Flat Data representation](https://flatgithub.com/102/omsk-weather).

This repo is a [GitHub Flat Data](https://octo.github.com/projects/flat-data)
playground and is not supposed to be used in any kind of serious research. The
data may be inconsistent both in terms of update period and format.
